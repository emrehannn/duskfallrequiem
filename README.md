# **🌒 Duskfall Requiem**

Duskfall Requiem is a high-performance Unity game project built to simulate 1,000–2,000+ active ragdoll rigidbodies in real-time. It achieves this using cutting-edge optimization technologies, including:

⚙️ Unity DOTS (Data-Oriented Tech Stack)

🚀 Burst Compiler

🧵 C# Job System

🧊 Unity Physics

🧠 GPU Compute Shaders

🧪 Various custom performance optimizations

## ⚡ Performance: 100x more efficient than titles like Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator or Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.
While UEBS and TABS rely on simpler systems or passive ragdolls due to performance constraints, Duskfall Requiem leverages active ragdolls at scale.

## 🚧 Project Status
Currently, there is no demo scene, but it is in development.
Note: Unity DOTS does not support skeletal mesh skinning at this time. If you're contributing or customizing visuals, keep this limitation in mind.

## 📋 To-Do List
• Implement enemy spawn logic using DOTS Entities

• Add player collision detection with DOTS-based entities

• Integrate terrain physics with DOTS rigidbodies

• Develop UI and Main Menu

• Add support for various player weapons

• Introduce level-based progression

• Create additional playable classes

## 💡 Contributing
If you're interested in contributing or collaborating, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request or open an issue. Feedback and collaboration are welcome!

## 📎 Requirements
Unity 6 (with DOTS/Unity Physics packages)

Burst Compiler

Entities Package

A reasonably powerful CPU for physics calculations, or alternatively you can adjust physics substepping.
